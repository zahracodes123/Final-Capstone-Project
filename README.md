# Final-Capstone-Project
Stock Price Prediction using S&P 500 data
This is my final capstone project. It is based on data from the S&P 500 Index, which is a benchmark index. The source of the data is Yfinance and 
here is a link to the data : https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/
First, I will use three Machine Learning Algorithms and compare the performance of all three by using RMSE and R Squared measures. The initial results of the 
project are posted in the repository already. In order to derive better results, the hyperparameters of one of the models (the Random Forest Regression Model) 
and the neighbors value for the KN Regression model will be changed and then the corresponding RMSE and R^2 values will be compared. Also the data used in the 
initial codes and results only spans about 3 years, I will also compare data spanning over 5 years in order increase the validity of the findings. 
The repository will thus contain the initial code, the final code and results.
